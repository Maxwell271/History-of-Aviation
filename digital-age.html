                <p>
                    The Information Age is generally understood to have arrived with the Internet as it was developed
                    through the 1970s and rolled out throughout the 1980s, and continues evolving to this day. So too
                    the adoption of digital techniques in aviation also arrived progressively at around the same time
                    and also continues today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The use of digital computers in aircraft design was developed by large aerospace companies
                    throughout the 1970s and included technique such as CAD, CAM, structural component stress analysis
                    using FEA and for aerodynamic modelling. Composite materials lend themselves better than metal to
                    fluid "organic" aerodynamic shapes of high efficiency, and the advent of sophisticated
                    computer-aided design and modelling has led to an expansion in the use of these materials and forms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Digital systems also appeared in the aircraft themselves and grew steadily in sophistication. The
                    first FADEC (Full Authority Digital Engine Control) trials took place in 1968, with the first
                    operational system entering service in 1985. The first operational fully authoritative
                    fly-by-wire system was developed for the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and its introduction
                    in 1978 heralded a revolution in taking over the task of ensuring stability in flight from the
                    traditional aerodynamic stabilizers. This use of "relaxed static stability" allowed aircraft to be
                    made more manoeuvrable and to be given an artificial "feel" to aid pilots in their main task.
                    Meanwhile, the "glass cockpit" was replacing the traditional analogue electro-mechanical
                    instrumentation with graphical digital displays which could display any information selected. Early
                    glass cockpits provided less critical flight information in the form of the EFIS system, with fully
                    glass systems appearing from 1988.

                    The Cold War era ended shortly after the arrival of digital technologies, bringing a marked decrease
                    of military aviation among the major powers. More recently the rise of the Indian and Chinese
                    economies has spurred development of military aircraft in these countries.

                        The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an American wide-body jet airliner developed and manufactured by
                        Boeing. On July 8, 2007, the prototype was rolled out without major systems and experienced
                        multiple delays until its maiden flight on December 15, 2009.

                        The Airbus A310 is a wide-body aircraft, designed and manufactured by Airbus. The A310
                        introduced a two-crew glass cockpit, later adopted for the A300-600 with a common type rating.

                        It was outfitted with an array of six computer-based cathode ray tube (CRT) displays to provide
                        the flight crew with centralised navigational, warning, monitoring, and general flight
                        information, in place of the more traditional analogue instrumentation and dials, which were
                        used in conjunction with a range of modern electronic systems.

                    <p>
                        Until the last delivery in June 1998, 255 aircraft were produced, as it was succeeded by the
                        larger Airbus A330-200. It was available as a cargo aircraft version, and was also developed
                        into a military variant, the A310 MRTT multi-role transport, then tanker.
