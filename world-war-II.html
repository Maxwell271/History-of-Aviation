                    During World War II, aviation firmly established itself as a critical component of modern warfare
                    from
                    the Battle of Britain in the early stages to the great aircraft carrier battles between American and
                    Japanese Pacific fleets and the final delivery of nuclear weapons. The major combatants – Germany
                    and
                    Japan on the one side and Britain, the United States and the USSR on the other – manufactured huge
                    air
                    forces which engaged in pitched battles both with each other and with the opposing ground forces.
                    Bombing established itself as a major strategic force, and this was also the first war in which the
                    aircraft carrier played a significant role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with Aviation in World War I, military investment during World War II drove aviation forward in
                    leaps
                    and bounds. The streamlined cantilever monoplane quickly proved its worth in almost every role,
                    although
                    a few older biplanes remained in niche roles for much of the war. Engine power and aircraft
                    performance
                    increased steadily, with jet and rocket engines beginning to make their appearance by the end of the
                    war. Avionics systems increased in sophistication and became more widespread, including
                    power-assisted
                    flight controls, blind flying instrumentation, radio communications and radar tracking.

                    The development of civil aviation stagnated until peace could be restored, and in the combatant
                    countries many existing civilian aircraft were pressed into military service. However military
                    technologies developed during the war would revolutionise postwar aviation. In particular, the
                    widespread construction of aerodromes with serviceable runways would provide the basis for a postwar
                    move of long-range passenger flights from flying boats to landplanes.

                        The Boeing B-29 Superfortress is an American four-engined propeller-driven heavy bomber,
                        designed by Boeing and flown primarily by the United States during World War II and the Korean
                        War.

                        B-29s dropped the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only aircraft ever to drop nuclear
                        weapons in combat.

                    <p>
                        One of the largest aircraft of World War II, the B-29 was designed with state-of-the-art
                        technology, which included a pressurized cabin, dual-wheeled tricycle landing gear, and an
                        analog computer-controlled fire-control system that allowed one gunner and a fire-control
                        officer to direct four remote machine gun turrets.

                        The Supermarine Spitfire is a British single-seat fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force
                        and other Allied countries before, during, and after World War II. Many variants of the Spitfire
                        were built, from the Mk 1 to the Rolls-Royce Griffon engined Mk 24 using several wing
                        configurations and guns.

                        It was the only British fighter produced continuously throughout the
                        war, and the Spitfire remains popular among enthusiasts, around 70 remain airworthy, and many
                        more are static exhibits in aviation museums throughout the world, with one being as far out as
                        Zimbabwe, said exhibit being Spitfire F Mk.22 PK355, a static display at Gweru Military Museum.
