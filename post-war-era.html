                    The period between 1945 and 1979 is sometimes called the post-war era or the period of the
                    post-war political consensus. During this period, aviation was dominated by the arrival of the Jet
                    Age. In civil aviation the jet engine allowed a huge expansion of commercial air travel, while in
                    military aviation it led to the widespread introduction of supersonic aircraft.

                            Did you know that jet engines also were being used for trains?

                <p>
                    By the end of the Second World War Germany and Britain already had operational jet aircraft in
                    military service. The next few years saw jet engines being developed by all the major powers and
                    military jet aircraft entering service with their air forces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Supersonic flight was achieved in 1947 by the American Bell X-1 rocket plane, however the use of
                    rocket engines would prove short lived. The development of the afterburner soon allowed jet engines
                    to provide similar levels of thrust and longer range, while needing no oxidant and being safer to
                    handle. The first supersonic jet to enter service was the North American F-100 Super Sabre, in 1954.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, commercial jetliners were being developed with the first of these, the British de
                    Havilland Comet, first flying in 1949 and entering service in 1952. The Comet suffered from a new
                    and unexpected problem now known as metal fatigue, several examples crashed and by the time a new
                    version was introduced, American types such as the Boeing 707 had overtaken its design and it was
                    not a commercial success. These types and their descendants contributed to an era of great social
                    change, typified by popular phrases such as "the jet set" and introducing new medical syndromes such
                    as jet lag.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Attempts were made to develop a supersonic airliner, with the Anglo-French Concorde and Soviet
                    Tupolev Tu-144 entering service during the 1970s, but they proved uneconomic in practice due to the
                    high fuel consumption at supersonic speeds. The associated pollution and sonic boom from these
                    aircraft also raised awareness of the Environmental impact of aviation, making it difficult to find
                    countries prepared to tolerate them.

                        The Concorde is a Franco-British supersonic airliner jointly
                        developed and manufactured by Sud Aviation (later AÃ©rospatiale) and the British Aircraft

                        Constructed out of aluminium, it was
                        the first airliner to have analogue fly-by-wire flight controls. The airliner could maintain a
                        supercruise up to Mach 2.04 (2,167 km/h; 1,170 kn) at an altitude of 60,000 ft (18.3 km).

                        Commercial service was suspended until November 2001, and Concorde aircraft were retired in 2003
                        after 27 years of commercial operations.

                        The Boeing 747 is a large, long-range wide-body airliner designed and manufactured by Boeing
                        Commercial Airplanes in the United States. The first flight took place on February 9, 1969, and
                        the 747 was certified in December of that year.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        The 747 was the first airplane dubbed "Jumbo Jet", the first wide-body airliner. The partial
                        double-deck aircraft was designed with a raised cockpit so it could be converted to a freighter
                        airplane by installing a front cargo door, as it was initially thought that it would eventually
                        be superseded by supersonic transports. Freighter variants of the 747 remain popular with cargo
                        airlines.

                    <p>
                        Manufacture of the 747 ended in 2022 after a 54-year production run.
