                    The pioneer era of aviation was the period of aviation history between the first
                    successful
                    powered
                    flight, generally accepted to have been made by the Wright Brothers on 17
                    December 1903, and the
                    outbreak of the First World War in August 1914.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the principles of powered controlled flight had been established there was
                    a period in
                    which
                    many
                    different aircraft configurations were experimented with. By 1914 the tractor
                    configuration
                    biplane
                    had
                    become the most popular form of aircraft design, and would remain so until the
                    end of the 1920s.
                    The
                    development of the internal combustion engine - primarily from their use in
                    early automobiles
                    even
                    before the start of the 20th century - which enabled successful heavier-than-air
                    flight also
                    produced
                    rapid advances in lighter-than-air flight, particularly in Germany where the
                    Zeppelin company
                    rapidly
                    became
                    the world leader in the field of airship construction.

                    During this period aviation passed from being seen as the preserve of eccentric
                    enthusiasts to
                    being
                    an
                    established technology, with the establishment of specialist aeronautical
                    engineering research
                    organizations and university courses and the creation of major industrial
                    aircraft manufacturing
                    businesses, and aviation became a subject of enormous popular interest. Flying
                    displays such as
                    the
                    Grande Semaine d'Aviation of 1909 and air races such as the Gordon Bennett
                    Trophy and the
                    Circuit of
                    Europe attracted huge audiences and successful pilots such as Jules Védrines and
                    Claude
                    Grahame-White
                    became celebrities.

                        The first example was used
