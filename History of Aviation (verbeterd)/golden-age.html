                    The 'Golden Age' of aviation is often associated with scenes of smiling hostesses serving
                    comfortable passengers in spacious cabins. Even though this these images reflect a time of when
                    commercial operations were starting to peak, it was the period before that was truly the Golden Age
                    of Aviation.
                    The interwar years between 1918 and 1939 saw a breakthrough in aviation that revolutionized the way
                    people fly. A key part of this period was the progression from the use of wooden biplanes to metal
                    monoplanes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biplane is what gave the Wright brothers their feat of the first successful flight in an
                    airplane. However, these builds were made from low powered engines and were designed in a way that
                    caused a lot of drag. Therefore, their wings could not handle much weight or harsh wind, so the
                    plane was vulnerable in longer flights.
                </p>

                            FUN FACT
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Did yu know that pilots and copilots on major airlines are not allowed to eat the same food,
                            to avoid the possibility of food poisoning sickening the entire flight crew.

                    This change was matched with the application of the jet engine further enhancing the efficiency of
                    flight. Longer flight times with less cabin vibration was achieved with the use of this engine type.
                    Both British and German engineers researched into the technology before Heinkel He178 became the
                    first jet-powered aircraft in 1939.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The years that followed this period saw tragedy in World War II with many institutions using the new
                    inventions for warfare. However, another period of progress following the war saw passengers benefit
                    from airlines using these builds effectively for consumer purposes.
                    Iconic airlines such as Pan Am invested in larger jet carriers such made by Boeing and McDonnell
                    Douglas. These institutions continued to dominate the aviation industry throughout the middle of the
                    20th century.

                        The Spirit of St. Louis (formally the Ryan NYP, registration: N-X-211) is the custom-built,
                        single-engine, single-seat, high-wing monoplane that was flown by Charles Lindbergh on May
                        20â€“21, 1927, on the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from Long Island, New York, to
                        Paris, France, for which Lindbergh won the $25,000 Orteig Prize.
