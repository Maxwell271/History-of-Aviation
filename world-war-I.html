                    World War I was the first major conflict involving the large-scale use of aircraft. Tethered
                    observation balloons had already been employed in several wars, and would be used extensively for
                    artillery spotting. Germany employed Zeppelins for reconnaissance over the North Sea and Baltic and
                    also for strategic bombing raids over Britain and the Eastern Front.

                    Aeroplanes were just coming into military use at the outset of the war. Initially, they were used
                    mostly for reconnaissance. Pilots and engineers learned from experience, leading to the development
                    of many specialized types, including fighters, bombers, and trench strafers.

                    Ace fighter pilots were portrayed as modern knights, and many became popular heroes. The war also
                    saw the appointment of high-ranking officers to direct the belligerent nations' air war efforts.

                <p>
                    While the impact of aircraft on the course of the war was mainly tactical rather than strategic,
                    most important being direct cooperation with ground forces (especially ranging and correcting
                    artillery fire), the first steps in the strategic roles of aircraft in future wars were also
                    foreshadowed.

                        The Sopwith Camel is a British First World War single-seat biplane fighter aircraft that was
                        introduced on the Western Front in 1917.

                    <p>
                        It was developed by the Sopwith Aviation Company as a
                        successor to the Sopwith Pup and became one of the best known fighter aircraft of the Great War.
